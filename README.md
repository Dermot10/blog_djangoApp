# Blog-application


This blog application was created using the django framework. 
User access was managed with the provided admin page and the primary logic exists within python script

Making use of varying back-end principles it incorporates differing practices including; HTTP protocol,
Server interaction, database management, user-authentication and password reset requests

It serves both static and dynamic content to the web-server when deployed allowing for CSS to handle the design. 
and dynamic content existing in the form of blog posts (POST requests) which interactively update the database.

SQLite is a RDBMS (Relational database management system) which is embedded into the django framework.
The database uses Models to classify the data which takes an OOP approach programming. 

User authentication allows for users to delete blog posts specific to their individual accounts, update profile pictures, 
and change their password. 

A request can be made to the user's email address in the case of forgotten password as a security measure to
change their passwords as well.
